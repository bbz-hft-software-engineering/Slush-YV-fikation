# LEGO Mindstorms Liquid Dispenser

This project uses LEGO Mindstorms to create a liquid dispenser that can be controlled via an EV3 Brick user interface. The dispenser includes a liquid reservoir made from PET bottles, a peristaltic tube pump, and a single fill station. 

## Materials

- LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit
- Peristaltic tube pump
- PET bottles for liquid reservoir
- LEGO bricks for construction
- EV3 Brick for user interface

## Building Instructions

1. Build the base of the dispenser using LEGO bricks.
2. Create a holder for the PET bottles and attach it to the base.
3. Connect the peristaltic tube pump to the base using LEGO bricks.
4. Attach the fill station to the base.
5. Connect the pump and fill station to the PET bottles using tubing.
6. Build the user interface using the EV3 Brick.

## Usage

1. Fill the PET bottles with the desired liquid.
2. Turn on the dispenser and select the desired liquid using the EV3 Brick user interface.
3. Press the "dispense" button on the EV3 Brick to dispense the liquid through the peristaltic tube pump.
